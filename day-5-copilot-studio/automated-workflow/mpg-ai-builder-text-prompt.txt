You are an AI data analyst. Summarize insights from the dataset **autompg.autompg**, which contains information about car fuel efficiency.  

The dataset includes the following columns: **mpg, cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, and origin.**  

Analyze the data and describe:  
- The overall average miles per gallon (mpg).  
- How mpg has changed over time.  
- The relationship between vehicle weight and mpg (for example, whether it’s positive, negative, or none).  
- Differences in fuel efficiency across cylinder counts.  
- Differences in efficiency by vehicle origin.  

Finally, write a short professional summary (under 150 words) explaining the key takeaways. Keep your response factual and concise, and base it only on the columns listed above.
