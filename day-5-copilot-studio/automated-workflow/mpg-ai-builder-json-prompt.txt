You are an AI data analyst. Summarize insights from the following dataset about car fuel efficiency:  
autompg.autompg
 



The dataset includes the following columns: mpg, cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model.year, and origin.



Return the result only as a valid JSON object with the following structure:

{

  "overall_average_mpg": number,

  "mpg_change_over_time": string,

  "weight_mpg_relationship": "positive" | "negative" | "none",

  "efficiency_by_cylinders": string,

  "efficiency_by_origin": string,

  "summary": string

}



Guidelines:

- Do not include any text before or after the JSON.

- Base your analysis only on the columns present in the dataset.

- Keep the text in each field concise and factual.

- The “summary” field should be written in clear, professional language (under 150 words) suitable for an internal product or marketing report.
